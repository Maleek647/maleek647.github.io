<p class="About-The-Team">
The school is prominently known for its boys basketball program, being one of the highest ranked high schools in Toronto as a member of the Toronto District Colleges Athletic Association (TDCAA), Ontario Scholastic Basketball Association (OSBA) and Ontario Federation of School Athletic Associations (OFSAA).[5] The Eastside Academy founded the prep program since the 2015-16 when they captured the OFSAA "AAA" title.

Since its inception, the boys basketball program has progressed from entry-level to competitive-level to perennial powerhouse, quickly becoming the "most consistently competitive" high school boys program in the country. Many of the Eastside basketball players have joined the rosters of basketball teams at every level from NCAA Basketball to Canadian National Teams and eventually the National Basketball Association.

Throughout its existence, the Eastside Academy had a rivalry with Eastern Commerce Saints until closing in 2015. The prep team has partnered with Air Jordan as the official supplier and sponsors of the Early Bird Classic and hosts the "Jordan Brand Players Lounge".[6]

The Academy Basketball holds their home games in the Father Ted McLean Gymnasium, dedicated by then-Principal Michael Rosseitti in 2012.</p>

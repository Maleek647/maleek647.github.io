  <p class="about-school">
  Eastside Catholic Academy is a Catholic Secondary School with a long and proud tradition of academic excellence.

The Basilian Fathers founded Eastside Catholic Academy  in 1962, as a boys' boarding school. Today, Eastside Catholic Academy is a co-educational institution and part of the Chento Catholic District School Board (CCDSB), educating young men & women in the Basilian tradition of excellence. Our school philosophy is embodied in our school motto, Excelsa Petite, which means, “Strive for Excellence”. Thus, at Eastside Academy the  aim is to provide, in a Catholic and Christian environment, the conditions that will enable each student to achieve the maximum possible development – intellectual, physical, spiritual and moral. We hope that our students will grow in an understanding of themselves and of each other. We strive to help each student grow both as an individual and as a responsible member of the community.

Students are expected to be responsible, contributing members of our educational community. They should exert the effort and discipline required to fulfill their potential, and should demonstrate an active respect for God, themselves, others, property and authority.<br></br>
